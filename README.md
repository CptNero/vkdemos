# Single file Vulkan example(s)

## vktriangle

Draws a triangle and saves it as a ppm image (with minimal "helper" methods).

See start of the [vktriangle.cpp](vktriangle/vktriangle.cpp) file on details how to compile and run.

## vktriangle_vertex

Draws a triangle using a single vertex input and saves it as a ppm image (with minimal "helper" methods).

See start of the [vktriangle_vertex.cpp](vktriangle_vertex/vktriangle_vertex.cpp) file on details how to compile and run.

Compare to the previous one to see the differences.

## vktriangle_glfw

Draws a triangle using a single vertex input on screen with GLFW and also saves it a frame to a ppm image (with minimal "helper" methods).

See start of the [vktriangle_glfw.cpp](vktriangle_glfw/vktriangle_glfw.cpp) file on details how to compile and run.

## vktriangle_descriptor

Draws a triangle using a single vertex input and a uniform buffer on screen with GLFW
and also saves a frame to a ppm image (with minimal "helper" methods).

See start of the [vktriangle_descriptor.cpp](vktriangle_descriptor/vktriangle_descriptor.cpp) file on details how to compile and run.
